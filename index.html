    <h2>About me</h2>
    I am an M.Eng. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, working in the Distributed Robotics Laboratory under the supervision of Prof. Daniela Rus. My primary research interest is in robotic perception and sensing, specifically in the problem of semantic world representation - how we can characterize features in the world in a succinct and useful manner. Through my research, I hope to develop perception and semantic scene understanding algorithms that enable autonomous mobile vehicles to have a better understanding of their environment. I am also generally interested in the problem of semantic SLAM - extending traditional SLAM algorithms to incorporate semantic landmark information.

    Previously, I have worked as a SuperUROP in the Spoken Language Systems group at MIT under the supervision of Dr. Jim Glass, and as a UROP in the Aerospace Controls Laboratory under the supervision of Dr. Golnaz Habibi and Prof. Jonathan How.
