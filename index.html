    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am an M.Eng. student in <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu">CSAIL</a> at MIT, working in the <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/distributed-robotics-laboratory">Distributed Robotics Laboratory</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu">Prof. Daniela Rus</a>. My primary research interest is in robotic perception and sensing, specifically in the problems of semantic scene understanding and world representation - how we can extract meaningful information about the world given unstructured sensor data.  I am also generally interested in the areas of Bayesian modeling and inference, machine learning, and robotic localization and mapping.</p>
   
    <p> My current research focuses on developing algorithms for the detection of unpaved roads in rural environments.
    Through my research, I hope to develop perception and semantic scene understanding algorithms that enable autonomous mobile vehicles to have a better understanding of their environment.</p>

    <p> Previously, I was a SuperUROP in the <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/sls/">Spoken Language Systems</a> group at MIT under the supervision of <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jrg/">Dr. Jim Glass</a>, and a UROP in the <a href="http://acl.mit.edu">Aerospace Controls Laboratory</a> under the supervision of Dr. Golnaz Habibi and <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~jhow/">Prof. Jonathan How</a>. </p>
